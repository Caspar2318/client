# Crazy practice on CRUD with FULL Stack developement and TypeScript applied.

# Website has been deployed at:

Transform a figma design into a fully functional website

following have been used along the way as:

NodeJS / Express / MongoDB / ReactJS / TypeScript / Material UI

cloudinary / Google Auth / refine

Practices make the best, we are not born to coding but we can build coding muscle to!!!

#npm create refine-app@latest client
option to choose as:

refine(CRA) => client => REST API => Material UI => Yes (example pages)

=> Yes (customize material ui theme) => Yes (customize material ui

layout) => Yes (add dark mode support) => Google (authentication logic

choice) => No (i18n support) => No (kbar command interface support)

cd client

#npm install apexcharts react-apexcharts

if met problem as 'An error saving your app occurs' while doing Google API & Services OAuth consent screen. Enter your project id as 'App Name' instead of name it yourself.

cd server => npm init -y => add "type":"module" inside package.json file under the "description"

#npm install cloudinary cors dotenv express mongoose nodemon

change the script inside server package.json file as "start": "nodemon index"
